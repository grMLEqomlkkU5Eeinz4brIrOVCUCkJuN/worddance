# WordDance: A Microservices Learning Project

WordDance is a simple word association game where players can create rooms, invite friends, and engage in word games together.

## Project Goal: A Microservices Learning Experience

This project is primarily a **learner project** focused on exploring the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem through a microservices architecture. You might notice what appears to be a peculiar combination of frameworks and tools (eventually). This is intentional! The core objective is to gain hands-on experience with various technologies within the JavaScript/TypeScript world, targeting both **Node.js** (express) and **Bun** (tanstack and elysia) runtimes.

Through WordDance, I aim to understand:
- Building and deploying multiple independent services.
- Inter-service communication patterns.
- Different backend frameworks and their strengths.
- Modern TypeScript development practices.
- Deployment strategies for Node.js and Bun applications.

This project prioritizes broad learning over strict technological uniformity, allowing for a diverse exploration of the ecosystem's tools and paradigms.
